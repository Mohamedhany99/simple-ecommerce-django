To start the project you need to create a virtual env and source it by running:
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


then run ./manage.py migrate

then ./maname.py runserver

and all the project is well commented and the API`s will find in the postman collection (ecommerce.postman_collection.json)
and all the API`s are documented on the Swagger docs but do not forget to open a VPN due to the banned cdn projects in Egypt.
